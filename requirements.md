**I. Introduction & Goals**

**1.1. Purpose of the Document**

This document serves as the Software Requirements Document (SRD) for an online Integrated Development Environment (IDE) specifically tailored for SvelteKit application development. It outlines the functional and non-functional requirements necessary for the development team to create and implement the online SvelteKit IDE. This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the product's intended features, functionalities, and quality attributes.

**1.2. Goals and Objectives**

The overarching goals of this online SvelteKit IDE are:

*   **To provide a frictionless environment for learning and developing SvelteKit applications directly in the browser:**  Eliminating the need for local environment setup, users can immediately start learning and experimenting with SvelteKit. This lowers the barrier to entry for new SvelteKit developers and makes it easier to share and demonstrate code.
*   **To enable rapid prototyping and experimentation with SvelteKit:** The IDE should facilitate quick iteration cycles, allowing developers to rapidly prototype ideas and experiment with different SvelteKit features and functionalities. This includes easy creation of projects, quick code edits, and immediate execution to visualize changes.
*   **To offer a convenient tool for quick code edits and demonstrations without local setup:** The online IDE provides a readily accessible tool for making quick code changes, demonstrating SvelteKit concepts, or debugging snippets of code without the overhead of setting up a local development environment. This is particularly useful for educators, collaborators, and developers needing to work on the go or on different machines.
*   **To be accessible and platform-agnostic:**  By being web-based, the IDE becomes accessible from any operating system with a modern web browser, enhancing its usability and reach across diverse user groups.

**1.3. Target Audience**

The primary target audience for this online SvelteKit IDE includes:

*   **Beginner Web Developers:** Individuals new to web development or SvelteKit. The IDE should provide an easy and intuitive starting point to learn SvelteKit without the complexities of local setup and tooling configuration. The focus for this group is on learnability and ease of use, with clear visual feedback and straightforward workflows.

This group will leverage the IDE for rapid prototyping, experimenting with new SvelteKit features, and quick project setups. They need efficiency in workflow and features that accelerate their development process.
*   **Experienced SvelteKit Developers:** While less likely to be the primary users for full-scale projects, experienced developers can utilize the IDE for quick code demonstrations, creating minimal reproducible examples for bug reports, or making rapid edits and tests when local IDE access is inconvenient. For this group, convenience and speed for specific tasks are key.
*   **Educators and Students:**  The IDE is ideal for educational purposes in web development courses or SvelteKit specific workshops. It allows students to focus on learning SvelteKit concepts without environment setup challenges and makes it easy for educators to provide a consistent and accessible development environment for all students.


**II. Overall Description**

**2.1. Product Perspective**

The online SvelteKit IDE is envisioned as a web application accessible through modern web browsers. It will be primarily a client-side application, meaning most of the processing, including code compilation and execution, will occur directly within the user's web browser. This approach minimizes server-side requirements, leveraging browser capabilities for a responsive and efficient user experience. The IDE will be delivered as a single-page application (SPA) to provide a desktop-like application feel within the browser.

**2.2. Product Features (High-Level)**

The online SvelteKit IDE will offer the following core features:

*   **Creation of SvelteKit base applications:**  Users can initiate new SvelteKit projects from within the IDE, setting up a basic project structure with essential files and configurations.
*   **Integrated code editor:** A feature-rich code editor will be embedded within the IDE, providing syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and other editing functionalities crucial for SvelteKit, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, and CSS development.
*   **File viewer for project navigation:** A file explorer panel will allow users to navigate the project structure, browse files and folders, and manage their project assets effectively.
*   **"Edit Mode" and "Run Mode" for development workflow:**  The IDE will operate in two distinct modes. "Edit Mode" for code editing and file management, and "Run Mode" to execute and preview the SvelteKit application. Users can switch between these modes seamlessly.
*   **Compilation of code within the browser environment:**  SvelteKit code (and related languages) will be compiled directly within the user's browser using in-browser compilers or transpilers. This allows for immediate feedback and execution without server-side compilation steps.
*   **Execution of compiled code within the browser environment:** The compiled SvelteKit application will be executed within the browser, allowing users to preview and interact with their application directly within the IDE interface.

**2.4. Operating Environment**

*   **Target Browsers:**
    *   Latest versions of Google Chrome
    *   Latest versions of Mozilla Firefox
    *   Latest versions of Apple Safari
    *   Latest versions of Microsoft Edge
    The IDE will be designed to function optimally on these browsers. While best-effort compatibility will be considered for older versions, full functionality and optimal performance are guaranteed only on the latest versions.
*   **Connectivity:**
    *   **Online-Only Operation:** The online SvelteKit IDE will be designed for online operation. A stable internet connection is required for initial loading of the application and for accessing necessary browser-based compiler/transpiler and runtime environments.
    *   **No Offline Capabilities:** Offline functionality is explicitly *not* a requirement for the initial version of the IDE. The complexities of offline compilation, execution, and storage are considered outside the scope of the initial release. This decision prioritizes simplicity and faster time-to-market.

**2.5. Design and Implementation Constraints**

*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Primarily Client-Side:** The IDE will be built primarily using client-side technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and TypeScript.
    *   **Browser APIs:** Extensive use of modern browser APIs will be necessary for file system access (in-browser sandboxed environment), in-browser compilation/transpilation, and execution.
    *   **Svelte/SvelteKit for UI Framework:**  Consider using Svelte or SvelteKit itself for building the IDE's user interface to leverage familiarity and framework capabilities.
*   **Performance Requirements:**
    *   **Compilation Speed:** Compilation and transpilation processes must be performant within the browser to provide a near-instant feedback loop.  Target compilation times should be under a second for small to medium-sized projects to maintain a smooth user experience.
    *   **Execution Speed:** Executed code performance is inherently limited by browser execution environments. However, the IDE should strive for acceptable execution speed for typical SvelteKit applications used for learning and prototyping. Performance benchmarks should be established and met.
    *   **UI Responsiveness:** The User Interface must remain responsive at all times, even during compilation and execution processes. Asynchronous operations and efficient UI rendering techniques must be employed to prevent UI blocking.
*   **Security Considerations:**
    *   **Code Execution Sandboxing:** Security is paramount. All user code execution must be strictly sandboxed within the browser environment to prevent any malicious code from accessing the user's system, browser data, or impacting other users. Implement robust sandboxing mechanisms provided by browser environments (e.g., iframes, web workers with limited permissions, or secure in-browser virtual machines if necessary and feasible).
    *   **Input Sanitization:** All user inputs, especially code entered into the editor, must be carefully sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities within the IDE itself.
*   **Resource Constraints:**
    *   **Reasonable Development Time and Resources:**  Assume a reasonable development team size and timeframe. Specific time and resource constraints will depend on project planning phases but should be considered during design and feature prioritization. The initial version should focus on core functionalities and can be iteratively enhanced.

**2.6. Assumptions and Dependencies**

*   **User Knowledge:** It is assumed that users have basic web development knowledge, including understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript fundamentals. While the IDE aims to be beginner-friendly, a basic understanding of these concepts is expected for effective SvelteKit development.
*   **Browser Compatibility:** The IDE's functionality heavily relies on browser compatibility with modern JavaScript features and Web APIs (e.g., File System Access API or similar sandboxed file system APIs, Web Workers, etc.). It is assumed that target browsers will fully support these necessary APIs. Regular testing across target browsers will be essential to ensure compatibility and address browser-specific issues.
*   **Availability of In-Browser Compilers/Transpilers:** The IDE depends on the availability and reliability of in-browser JavaScript compilers and transpilers for SvelteKit, TypeScript, and potentially other languages. It is assumed that libraries like `esbuild`, `swc`, or similar technologies can be effectively integrated for in-browser compilation and that these libraries will be actively maintained and updated.


**III. Specific Requirements (Functional Requirements)**

**3.1. File Management (File Viewer)**

*   **3.1.1. File Tree:**
    *   A file tree panel will be displayed on the left side of the IDE interface.
    *   It will visually represent the project directory structure in a hierarchical tree format.
    *   Users can expand and collapse folders to navigate the directory structure.
    *   File icons will be used to visually distinguish different file types (e.g., `.svelte`, `.js`, `.css`, folders).
*   **3.1.2. File Operations:**
    *   **Creating New Files and Folders:** Users can right-click on folders or within the file tree to open a context menu with options to create new files and folders. Prompts will be provided for naming new files and folders.
    *   **Deleting Files and Folders:** Users can right-click on files or folders to access a "Delete" option in the context menu. Deletion actions will require confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.
    *   **Renaming Files and Folders:** Users can right-click on files or folders and select "Rename" from the context menu. An in-place editor will allow users to modify the name.
    *   **Opening Files:** Double-clicking on a file in the file tree will open the file in the code editor panel.
    *   **Saving Files:**
        *   Changes made in the code editor will be automatically saved periodically (autosave - configurable interval, e.g., every 5 seconds).
        *   A "Save" option (e.g., in a File menu or using `Ctrl+S`/`Cmd+S` shortcut) will also be available to manually trigger saving.
    *   **(Optional) Uploading/Downloading Files/Projects:**
        *   **Upload (Optional for initial version):** Consider adding a feature to upload individual files or entire projects (as ZIP archives) into the IDE's virtual file system.
        *   **Download (Optional for initial version):** Consider allowing users to download individual files or the entire project as a ZIP archive.

*   **3.1.3. File Types:**
    *   The IDE will recognize and handle the following file types appropriately:
        *   `.svelte`: Svelte component files (syntax highlighting, compilation).
        *   `.js`: JavaScript files (syntax highlighting, compilation/transpilation).
        *   `.ts`: TypeScript files (syntax highlighting, compilation/transpilation).
        *   `.html`: HTML files (syntax highlighting).
        *   `.css`: CSS files (syntax highlighting).
        *   Project configuration files (e.g., `svelte.config.js`, `jsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.json` - basic recognition for potential future features).
        *   Other common web development files (e.g., `.json`, `.txt`, `.md` - basic text file handling).

**3.2. Code Editor**

*   **3.2.1. Basic Editing Features:**
    *   **Syntax Highlighting:** Provide syntax highlighting for:
        *   Svelte syntax in `.svelte` files.
        *   JavaScript and TypeScript syntax in `.js` and `.ts` files.
        *   HTML syntax in `.html` and `.svelte` files.
        *   CSS syntax in `.css` and `<style>` blocks in `.svelte` files.
    *   **Auto-indentation:** Automatically indent code based on language conventions when starting new lines or pasting code.

*   **3.2.2. Advanced Editing Features (Consider adding these):**
    *   **Autocompletion/IntelliSense:**
        *   Provide autocompletion suggestions for SvelteKit APIs, JavaScript/TypeScript APIs, HTML tags and attributes, and CSS properties.
        *   Offer IntelliSense features like code hints, parameter info, and signature help as users type.
    *   **Error Highlighting/Linting (basic static analysis):**
        *   Perform basic static analysis in the background and highlight syntax errors and potential code issues directly in the editor with visual cues (e.g., wavy underlines).
        *   Display error messages on hover over highlighted code.
    *   **(Optional) Code Formatting (e.g., Prettier integration):**
        *   Consider integrating a code formatter like Prettier to allow users to automatically format their code to a consistent style.  This could be triggered manually (e.g., via context menu or shortcut) or on save (optional and configurable).
    *   **(Optional) Multiple Cursors:**
        *   Allow users to create and use multiple cursors for simultaneous editing in multiple locations.
    *   **(Optional) Code Snippets:**
        *   Provide a library of pre-defined code snippets for common SvelteKit patterns, HTML elements, and JavaScript/TypeScript constructs to speed up coding.

**3.3. SvelteKit Project Creation**

*   **3.3.1. "Create SvelteKit App" Feature:**
    *   A clear UI element (e.g., a button labeled "Create SvelteKit App" in the file viewer or main menu) will be provided to initiate project creation.
    *   Upon clicking this element, a modal or inline input field will appear, prompting the user to enter a project name.
    *   After entering a project name and confirming, the IDE will automatically generate a basic SvelteKit project structure in the file viewer.
*   **3.3.2. Project Structure:**
    *   The generated project structure will mimic a standard, minimal SvelteKit base application structure, including:
        *   `src/` directory:
            *   `routes/` directory: (for route files)
                *   `+page.svelte` (default index page)
            *   `app.html` (basic HTML template)
        *   `svelte.config.js` (minimal configuration file)
        *   `package.json` (with minimal dependencies for SvelteKit)
        *   `jsconfig.json` or `tsconfig.json` (basic configuration for JavaScript or TypeScript support respectively - default to JavaScript project for simplicity in the initial version).
*   **3.3.3. (Optional) Templates or Starter Options:**
    *   **(Optional for initial version):** Consider adding a selection step after project name input to allow users to choose from basic SvelteKit templates or starter options (e.g., "Blank Project," "Basic Layout," "Minimal Blog").
    *   If templates are included, provide concise descriptions for each to help users choose appropriately.

**3.4. Compilation and Execution (Run Mode)**

*   **3.4.1. "Compile" Button/Action:**
    *   A "Compile" button or similar UI element (e.g., within the toolbar or context menu) will be provided in "Edit Mode."
    *   Clicking this button will trigger the compilation process.
    *   Compilation could also be triggered automatically in the background upon file saving (configurable option, disabled by default for initial version, manual compile button is primary).
*   **3.4.2. Compilation Process:**
    *   **Browser-based Transpilation:**  For the initial version, a lightweight, in-browser transpilation approach using a tool like `esbuild` or `swc` is recommended for speed and simplicity.  "Real" compilation in the browser might be overly complex and resource-intensive for the initial scope.
    *   **Process Outline:**
        1.  Upon "Compile" action, the IDE will gather all relevant project files (primarily `.svelte`, `.js`, `.ts` and potentially other assets).
        2.  The chosen in-browser transpiler (e.g., `esbuild`) will be invoked to transpile Svelte components and TypeScript/JavaScript code into browser-compatible JavaScript.
        3.  Generated JavaScript code, along with necessary HTML and CSS, will be prepared for execution within the browser environment.
*   **3.4.3. Error Handling during Compilation:**
    *   **Error Display:** Compilation errors will be displayed to the user in a clear and informative manner.
    *   **Error Panel/Console:** A dedicated panel (e.g., below the editor or in a separate tab) will be used to display compilation error messages.
    *   **Error Highlighting in Editor:**  Where possible, compilation errors should also be highlighted directly within the code editor, ideally with line numbers and error descriptions displayed on hover.
*   **3.4.4. "Run Mode" Activation:**
    *   A toggle switch or a similar UI element (e.g., a button labeled "Run") will be used to switch between "Edit Mode" and "Run Mode."
    *   After successful compilation, users can activate "Run Mode" using this toggle.
*   **3.4.5. Execution Environment:**
    *   **Iframe Execution:** The compiled SvelteKit application will be executed within an `iframe` embedded in the IDE interface when in "Run Mode."
    *   **Output Display:** The output of the running SvelteKit application (the rendered web page) will be displayed within this iframe.
    *   **Console Output (Optional for initial version):**  Consider displaying browser console output (e.g., `console.log` messages) in a separate panel in "Run Mode" for basic debugging (optional for initial version but highly valuable for later enhancements).
*   **3.4.6. "Stop" or "Restart" Execution:**
    *   **Restart Execution:**  Switching from "Run Mode" back to "Edit Mode" and then recompiling and re-entering "Run Mode" will effectively restart the application.
    *   **Explicit "Stop" (Optional):** Consider adding an explicit "Stop" button in "Run Mode" to terminate the running application within the iframe if needed (optional for initial version).

**3.5. Mode Switching (Edit/Run Toggle)**

*   **3.5.1. Toggle Functionality:**
    *   The toggle will provide a clear and immediate switch between "Edit Mode" and "Run Mode."
    *   In "Edit Mode," the code editor and file management features are prominent.
    *   In "Run Mode," the compiled application output in the iframe is prominently displayed, with potentially reduced file management or editor focus.
*   **3.5.2. UI Element:**
    *   A toggle switch (on/off style) or a button (with labels like "Edit" and "Run") located in the main toolbar is suitable for mode switching. The visual state of the toggle/button should clearly indicate the current active mode.

**3.6. User Interface (UI) Considerations**

*   **3.6.1. Layout:**
    *   **Split-Panel Layout:** Employ a split-panel layout for efficient use of screen space.
        *   **Left Panel:** Code Editor (dominant and largest panel).
        *   **Right Panel:** File Viewer (smaller, collapsible panel).
        *   **Bottom Panel (or Tabbed Panel):**  Compilation Error Output / (Optional) Console Output. The output area can be collapsible or toggleable to maximize editor space when not needed.
    *   **Toolbar:** A toolbar at the top of the IDE interface for common actions like "Create SvelteKit App," "Compile," "Save," and the "Edit/Run" toggle.
*   **3.6.2. Visual Design:**
    *   **Clean and Modern Style:**  Adopt a clean, modern visual design to enhance usability and reduce visual clutter.
    *   **(Optional) Dark/Light Theme Options:** Consider offering both dark and light theme options to cater to user preferences and reduce eye strain in different lighting conditions (optional for initial version).
    *   **Consistent Visual Language:** Maintain a consistent visual language across all UI elements (icons, buttons, panels) for a cohesive user experience.
*   **3.6.3. Responsiveness:**
    *   **Responsive Design:** The IDE UI must be responsive and adapt well to different screen sizes and browser window dimensions. It should be usable on various screen resolutions, from desktop monitors to laptop screens and potentially larger tablets (though tablet-specific optimizations might be considered in later iterations).
    *   **Fluid Layout:** Use fluid layout techniques (e.g., Flexbox, Grid) to ensure panels resize gracefully when the browser window is resized.


**IV. Non-Functional Requirements (Quality Attributes)**

**4.1. Usability**

*   **4.1.1. Ease of Use:**
    *   **Intuitive Interface:** The IDE's user interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate, even for users unfamiliar with online IDEs.

*   **4.1.2. Learnability:**
    *   **Discoverable Features:**  Key features and functionalities should be easily discoverable through clear UI elements and logical menu organization.
    *   **Contextual Help (Optional):** Consider providing contextual help tips or tooltips for UI elements (optional for initial version, but valuable for beginners).
    *   **Example Projects/Tutorials (Future Enhancement):**  Future versions could include example SvelteKit projects or interactive tutorials integrated into the IDE to aid learning.
*   **4.1.3. Efficiency:**
    *   **Fast Task Completion:** Users should be able to perform common development tasks (editing, compiling, running) quickly and efficiently within the IDE.
    *   **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Implement common keyboard shortcuts (e.g., `Ctrl+S` for save, `Ctrl+F` for find, `Ctrl+Shift+F` for format - if code formatting is included) to improve efficiency for experienced users.
    *   **Minimized Clicks:** Design workflows to minimize the number of clicks and interactions required to perform frequent tasks.

**4.2. Performance**

*   **4.2.1. Compilation Speed:**
    *   **Target < 1 Second for Small Projects:** Compilation times for typical small to medium-sized SvelteKit projects (as used in learning and prototyping scenarios) should ideally be under 1 second.
    *   **Progress Indicator:**  Provide a visual progress indicator during compilation to inform the user about the ongoing process, especially for longer compilations (though aiming for fast compilation should minimize the need).
*   **4.2.2. Execution Speed:**
    *   **Acceptable Browser Performance:**  The executed SvelteKit application should run with acceptable performance within the browser environment. While browser performance might not match native execution, it should be sufficient for learning, prototyping, and demonstrating basic SvelteKit functionalities.
    *   **Avoid Lag and Freezes:** The IDE itself and the executed application within the iframe should avoid noticeable lag or freezes. Optimize code and UI rendering for smooth performance.
*   **4.2.3. Responsiveness of UI:**
    *   **Immediate UI Feedback:** The UI should respond immediately to user interactions (typing in the editor, clicking buttons, navigating the file tree).
    *   **Asynchronous Operations:** Perform potentially time-consuming operations (like compilation) asynchronously in Web Workers or using other non-blocking techniques to prevent UI freezes and maintain responsiveness.

**4.3. Reliability**

*   **4.3.1. Stability:**
    *   **Minimize Crashes and Errors:** The IDE should be stable and operate without frequent crashes or unexpected errors during normal usage scenarios.
    *   **Robust Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling to gracefully manage unexpected situations and prevent application crashes.
*   **4.3.2. Error Handling:**
    *   **Informative Error Messages:** Error messages (especially compilation errors) should be informative and provide sufficient context to help users understand and resolve the issue.
    *   **Clear Error Presentation:** Display error messages clearly in a dedicated error panel and ideally highlight the location of the error in the code editor.
    *   **Graceful Degradation:** In case of unexpected errors or issues, the IDE should degrade gracefully rather than crashing completely.

**4.4. Security**

*   **4.4.1. Code Execution Sandboxing:**
    *   **Iframe Isolation:** Primarily rely on the browser's `iframe` security model to sandbox executed code. The SvelteKit application will run within an iframe, isolating it from the main IDE application and the user's system.
    *   **Limited Permissions (Web Workers):** If Web Workers are used for compilation or other background tasks, ensure they are created with limited permissions and cannot access sensitive browser data or APIs outside their intended scope.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict Content Security Policy for the IDE application to further mitigate XSS risks and control the resources the IDE and the executed code can access.
    *   **Regular Security Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and address potential vulnerabilities in the IDE's code and sandboxing mechanisms.
*   **4.4.2. Data Security (Less Relevant for Basic IDE):**
    *   **No User Data Storage (Initial Version):** For the initial version, explicitly avoid storing any user code or project data persistently. The IDE will be stateless, and projects exist only within the browser's session memory.  Clearly communicate this to users.
    *   **Local Browser Storage (Future - if implemented):** If persistent storage is considered in future versions (e.g., using `localStorage` or `IndexedDB`), implement appropriate security measures to protect user data from unauthorized access and ensure data privacy. Data encryption at rest and in transit should be considered if sensitive data is to be stored.

**4.5. Maintainability**

*   **4.5.1. Code Structure:**
    *   **Modular Design:** Design the IDE's codebase with a modular architecture, separating concerns into well-defined modules and components. This will improve code readability, maintainability, and testability.
    *   **Clear Code Style:** Adhere to consistent coding conventions and style guidelines (e.g., using ESLint, Prettier) to ensure code uniformity and readability across the codebase.
    *   **Comprehensive Documentation:** Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for the IDE's codebase, including architecture diagrams, API documentation, and developer guides, to facilitate future maintenance and enhancements.
*   **4.5.2. Extensibility:**
    *   **Plugin Architecture (Future Enhancement):** Consider designing the IDE with a plugin architecture in mind for future extensibility. This would allow adding new features, languages, or integrations without modifying the core IDE codebase.
    *   **Well-Defined APIs:** Expose well-defined APIs and extension points to facilitate plugin development and future feature additions.

**4.6. Portability/Compatibility**

*   **4.6.1. Browser Compatibility:**
    *   **Target Browser Testing:**  Conduct thorough testing of the IDE across all specified target browsers (latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent functionality and performance.
    *   **Browser-Specific Workarounds:**  Implement browser-specific workarounds or polyfills where necessary to address browser compatibility issues and ensure consistent behavior across different browsers.
    *   **Automated Browser Testing:** Set up automated browser testing (using tools like Cypress, Selenium, or Playwright) to regularly verify browser compatibility and detect regressions as the IDE evolves.


**V. Future Enhancements (Optional, but good to consider)**

*   **Collaboration Features (Shared Editing):** Real-time collaborative editing capabilities, allowing multiple users to work on the same project simultaneously.
*   **Debugging Tools:**  Integrated debugging features, such as breakpoints, step-through execution, and variable inspection, to aid in debugging SvelteKit applications within the browser IDE.
*   **Version Control Integration (e.g., Basic Git):** Basic Git integration to allow users to initialize Git repositories, commit changes, and potentially push/pull from remote repositories (simplified Git functionality, not a full-fledged Git client).
*   **More Advanced SvelteKit Features or Integrations:** Support for more advanced SvelteKit features as they evolve, and integrations with SvelteKit ecosystem tools or libraries.
*   **Theming and Customization Options:**  Allow users to customize the IDE's appearance through themes, font selections, and layout adjustments.
*   **Persistent Project Storage:** Implement options for users to save projects persistently (e.g., using local browser storage or cloud storage integrations) to resume work later.
*   **Code Snippet Library Expansion:** Expand the library of code snippets for SvelteKit and related technologies.
*   **Interactive Tutorials and Learning Resources:** Integrate interactive tutorials or links to SvelteKit learning resources directly within the IDE.


**VI. Glossary (Optional, but helpful for complex terms)**

*   **Compilation:** In the context of this IDE, "compilation" or more accurately "transpilation" refers to the process of converting Svelte, TypeScript, and other source code into browser-compatible JavaScript code that can be executed by web browsers. This process happens within the user's browser environment.
*   **Run Mode:**  The IDE mode where the compiled SvelteKit application is executed and displayed within the browser environment, allowing users to interact with and preview their application.
*   **SvelteKit Base App:** Refers to a minimal SvelteKit project structure containing the essential files and folders required to run a basic SvelteKit application. This typically includes a `src/routes` directory with a `+page.svelte` file, `app.html`, `svelte.config.js`, and `package.json`.
*   **Sandboxing:**  The security mechanism used to isolate the execution of user code within the browser environment, preventing it from accessing the user's system or other sensitive data. In this IDE, sandboxing is primarily achieved through the browser's `iframe` security model.
*   **Transpilation:** In the context of front-end development, often used interchangeably with "compilation," but more accurately describes the process of converting code from one source language (e.g., TypeScript, Svelte) to another (JavaScript) at a similar level of abstraction, primarily for browser compatibility.
